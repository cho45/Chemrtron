### Elements in progress

* 

### Elements planned
_Elements we're planning on building soon but haven't started yet_

* `paper-chip` - a [material design chip](http://www.google.com/design/spec/components/chips.html)
* `paper-data-table` - a [material design data table](http://www.google.com/design/spec/components/data-tables.html). This one is very complex, and tentatively planned for the mid- to distant-future (i.e. months not weeks)

### Elements not planned, notably
_Elements we're not planning on building as part of this product line, but that one might be wondering about_

* `paper-shadow` - this behavior is now provided by [`paper-material`](https://github.com/polymerelements/paper-material)
